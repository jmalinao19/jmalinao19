# Welcome to Joe's Page!  👋

Haven't pushed many of my projects and work on here but I'm working on changing that! 
Seeking to contribute more to data focused tools I find useful or interesting.


## About me 
I'm a curious and life long learner interested in a wide variety of subjects but professionally within the intersections of healthcare, operations, data engineering/infrastructure. I previously thought a career in medicine/surgery was my calling until I learned about harnessing data and other technical innovations will drastically change the healthcare/medical field. My journey in technology was unexpected and was purely driven by my curiosity on how information is captured and process within a system to drive analytical insights. This ultimately inspired me to develop cross-functional technical knowledge in data analytics, machine learning, data engineering, and DevOps. I consider myself well rounded and have solid foundation with various data analysis and data engineering concepts/tools, although I'm always seeking ways to continously learn more and improve my skills. 

## Education 
- **Bachelor:** Pre - Medicine (Minor: Analytics) @ Saint Mary's University of Minnesota _(2017)_
- **Masters:** Computer Science @ DePaul University (_In Progress_)

## Occupation 
Currently at Amazon wearing a different hat working in operations to further understand their operational excellence. I'd consider it a hands-on mini "MBA" to see first hand how Amazon fulfills the gargantuan amount of inventory and orders they process daily. Some concepts I've learned inculde: process improvement (Lean/six sigma), their ability to scale, reporting systems, labor tracking/management, and how various tools can help/hinder the operational bottom line. 

I'm also working on my computer science degree part-time and learning other data tools/systems.
